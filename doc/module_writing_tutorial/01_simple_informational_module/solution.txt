This is a solution text file that contains detailed information that will
be a part of the report file. You can put here an informational message, like
this one, or some instructions to resolve issues.

The file can stay empty and the text can be generated by the check script
itself. Usually, you put here information that is static and you do not want
to generate it by the script every time the script is run.

NOTE: In case that the module result is PASS (the module ends by "exit_pass"),
the content of the solution file is ignored and not printed.

As an example, this file might contain a text similar to this one:

* A new system, which you want to use, contains many interesting features,
which could make your work much more effective. See the knowledge base article
for full info at: http://example.com/the-most-beautiful-features.
