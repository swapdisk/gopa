#############################################################
### required ###
# content_title         - A title of the module.
#
# content_description   - A brief description of the module.

### optional ###
# applies_to            - A list of packages (separated by commas) that have
#                         to be installed to make the module applicable. E.g.,
#                         when the module checks httpd, httpd must be
#                         installed.
#
# binary_req            - A list of binaries (separated by commas) that are
#                         required for the correct functionality of the module.
#                         The module will print error and will not be
#                         processed, when any of the required binaries
#                         is missing on the system. Usually common binaries
#                         (like cp, grep, find, ...) do not have to be required
#                         here and should be a part of requirements of the RPM
#                         with modules.
#
# requires              - A list of packages separated by commas. Analogically
#                         to binary_req above.
#
# config_file           - A list of configuration files (separated by commas)
#                         that are important for the module. It has just
#                         an informational value in the generated report
#                         for the administrator.
#
# author                - The name of the author of the content with the email.
#                         Usually in a format:
#                         Name Surname <email>
#
# bugzilla              - A list of ID numbers of bugs in bugzilla separated
#                         by commas that serves as the information for other
#                         developers, to see a bugzilla relevant to the module,
#                         if it exists.
