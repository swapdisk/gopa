preupg-diff \- manual page for preupg-diff 1.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: preupg\-diff [\-h] [\-s] [\-v] [\-\-version] ANALYZED [ANALYZED ...] NEW
.PP
preupg\-diff compares multiple Preupgrade Assistant reports and shows issues
that are unique to the last one. For example, you have 3 reports, all of which
you have already analyzed and are aware of issues raised there, and one new
report. Instead of reading through all items in the new report, this tool will
go through all rule results in the last report and will hide those that have
same content (e.g. solution proposal and risks) as at least one of the
previous reports. The trimmed report is output in XML and HTML format and
named result_diff.xml/html.
