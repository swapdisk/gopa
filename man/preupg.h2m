[DESCRIPTION]
The Preupgrade Assistant is a framework designed to run the Preupgrade Assistant modules, which analyze the system for possible in-place upgrade limitations. It is based on a modular system, with each module performing a separate test, checking for package removals, incompatible obsolete packages, changes in libraries, users, groups, services, or incompatibilities of command-line options or configuration files. It is able to execute post-upgrade scripts to finalize complex tasks after the system upgrade. Apart from performing the in-place upgrades, the Preupgrade Assistant is also capable of migrating the system. It then produces a report, which assists you in performing the upgrade itself by outlining potential problem areas and by offering suggestions about mitigating any possible incompatibilities. The Preupgrade Assistant utility is a Red Hat Upgrade Tool prerequisite for completing a successful in-place upgrade to the next major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
